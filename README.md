# Notebook image

The base image is `ubi8/python39` based. All files are under [here](jupyter/minimal/ubi8-python-3.9/). Image is created using a modified base image of [redhat python39 image](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/rhel8/python-39/6065b20a0376735023221b11?container-tabs=dockerfile). Repo is in [fork](https://github.com/expruc/s2i-python-container) from original base image repository.

To build the image go to [minimal](jupyter/minimal/ubi8-python-3.9/) directory and build the image. More instructions are found in the [readme](jupyter/minimal/ubi8-python-3.9/README.md) there.
